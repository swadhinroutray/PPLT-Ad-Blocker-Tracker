# Measuring Ad-Blocker Efficiency and Privacy

Course Project, Poster and Report for CMU-17733 - Privacy, Policy, Law and Technology

## Abstract

This research study aims to conduct and provide insights
into Ad-Blocker efficiency and privacy. It is no surprise that
with the advent of the internet, digital advertisements have
become commonplace since most people spend a significant
time online. These advertisements, while useful sometimes,
tend to be intrusive and invade user privacy. We aim to find
the best possible ad blocker in terms of efficiency and privacy
protection, by running experiments with the most popular ad
blocker options on Fortune 250 websites. We aim to derive a
comparative result on the basis of our experiments.
